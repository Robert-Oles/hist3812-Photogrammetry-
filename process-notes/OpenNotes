Went down to Parliament Hill to the Famous Five Statues located on the east end of the hill. The time was 2:15 by the time I had started taking photos. 

This resulted in weird lighting for my photos as the sun was to the west making it difficult to get balanced lighting
**Side note, if I were to do this assignment again, and if I were to select and outdoor statue I would have to find a better time of day in order to get good enough photos.** 

While I took a number of photosets which I will upload along side this project, the primary one was of the head of Louise McKinney. I took 36 photos using the SCANN3D applications guided mode, in order to get the best model possible. 

Unfortunately, the model failed to render.

**Side note, what kind of person designs a software to produce an error message without any specific code or unique description to help the trouble shooting process**

I continued this process taking a few more complete photosets using the guided function and all resulted in the same failed result. 

So, defeated I began heading home until I stopped at the Tomb of the Unknown solider where I stopped to take a look before I saw the statue of Sir Arthur Currie. I decided to give it one last go before calling it quits and I again took a full 360 photoset containing 28 photos using the guided mode of SCANN3D. This however was a “success” in the sense that it completed a render of the statue that was completely concave. This model will also be available on my GitHub

After examining examples from the class I saw the awesome render of the Terry Fox Statue in regard3d and decided to give it a try.
I downloaded the software from: http://www.regard3d.org/index.php/download then installed and transferred my photoset from my Nexus 6p phone over to my computer. 

I was then faced with the problem that the metadata did not transfer over with the photos so I needed to use the EGIF Pilot application: Downloaded from: http://www.colorpilot.com/products.html to alter the metadata of the photos so that it was useable by Regard3D. I manually inputted the focal length: 26.6 mm for my camera, before realizing that I also needed to add my camera to the database of accepted cameras. This was done by using notepad++ to alter the phone database file in regard3d’s directory folder. 
After this was done, I began attempting to render my model, which after 43 minutes and 53 seconds, we had our matches computed. This was done on the highest sensitivity setting with the hopes of getting as much detail as possible. 
Next was triangulation, which had depressing results, after a short time, it came back with 4 out of 36 calibrated.  This is where I started to get worried because I believed that the project was lost and would be a complete failure since the output I was seeing at this point was incredibly sparse dots. However, I continued anyway with densification, which after running through on the default settings (seen below) 
This produced an output that looked like the face of the statue! After this I was motivated to continue and created a surface for the model again using the default settings. 

**If we are looking for an AHA! Moment it was right here, after being frustrated with failure after failure to see something actually looking like what I wanted it to was such an awesome feeling**

Now this was what I had been waiting for, after the surface generation was complete I was left with a model that looked like the face of Louise McKinney. While my model is no where near the detail and completeness of the Terry Fox statue, I am legitimately proud of this work, not because of the outcome but rather the amount I learned while doing this assignment. I have learned so much about how cameras work, how things like focal length and sensor width vary from camera to camera and how that impacts outputs. On top of all the stuff I have learned about metadata and photogrammetry software. 

**Final Sidenote, EXIF Pilot, while a great program and is “open source” requires a 79.99 USD purchase in order to do batch meta data editing, which is just gross.**
